#Quick-OpenCV

By using this program you can directly start working on your openCV proccess instead of wasting time with swing stuff.

##How-to
 - Import the project to eclipse workspace
 - You need to import openCV files in order to start working with the code!
 - You should write your openCV process under the function named whatToDoFunc
 
 whatToDoFunc(){
   //Write your functions here

   //End of whatToDoFunc
 }

 - You have to use the variable named 'image' as a start.
	static Mat image;
 - Then keep going with 'dest' variable.
 - Be careful. JFrame will use 'dest' variable when printing the final image.

##Note
 - You can later edit the program so that it shows another JFrame for the original video.


I hope you enjoy it.

Thank you,
